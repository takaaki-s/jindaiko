# Gotchas

Common pitfalls and caveats that agents tend to fall into.

## tmux

- **remain-on-exit is set at the pane level** (not globally).
  `TagManagedPane()` applies it only to managed panes.
  Panes added by the user are destroyed immediately.
  (Fixed in commit 980e99f)

- **tmux session name** is the `tmux.SessionName` constant ("jin"). Do not change it.

- **inner tmux**: jind-ai uses its own tmux socket (`-L jin`).
  It runs as a separate server process from the user's main tmux.

- **base-index issue**: If `base-index=1` is set in the user's `~/.tmux.conf`,
  the `:0.0` target becomes invalid. Use pane IDs (`%N`) instead.

## Hook

- **Session identification uses the `JIN_SESSION_ID` environment variable** (most reliable).
  Claude Code's session ID is used as a fallback.
  (Improved in commit a0bd6f7)

- **CWD tracking uses the hook's `cwd` field**.
  tmux's `pane_current_path` is also polled, but the hook takes priority.
  (Added in commit a705a80)

## Codex adapter

- **Initial `/hooks` trust approval is required.** The first time `jin
  session new --agent codex` runs in a given install (or after the `jin`
  binary path changes), Codex shows a `Hooks need review — N hooks are new
  or changed` dialog. Select **"Trust all and continue"** to enable status
  tracking. The trust hash is persisted to `~/.codex/config.toml` under
  `[hooks.state]`, so subsequent spawns skip the dialog as long as the
  command path stays the same. `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` is not
  used by jind-ai on purpose (see 02_design.md §3.3).

- **30 s poll fallback during the trust dialog is harmless.** Between
  session spawn and the user's trust confirmation, no hook fires. The
  daemon's `[POLL] no hook received for 30s, fallback` path takes the
  status from `running` down to `idle`. Once trust lands, subsequent
  `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` hooks drive the status correctly. If you see
  the poll fallback in normal use, the trust dialog is usually still open
  in the pane.

- **Directory trust ("Do you trust this directory?")** is a separate
  Codex sandbox prompt shown on the first launch in a given cwd; it is
  unrelated to `/hooks` and answered independently.

- **`AgentSessionID` is unknown until SessionStart.** Codex has no
  `--session-id` equivalent (openai/codex#13242). jind-ai spawns fresh
  `codex` on first start, ignores the pre-minted UUID it created for the
  Session record, and lets the `SessionStart` hook's stdin JSON carry the
  real Codex UUID back — the existing re-key path
  (`manager.go:1231-1234`) latches it without any daemon change. On
  resume, `codex resume <UUID>` fast-fails in a few seconds for unknown
  IDs, so the existing 10-second quick-fail auto-recovery covers the
  "session removed by hand" edge case without a defensive pre-glob.

- **`Layer C-transcript` reads the rollout JSONL.** The Codex enhancer
  extracts the first `role: "user"` message that is not a
  `<environment_context>` pseudo-user injection. See
  `internal/agent/codex/rollout.go`.

## Agent picker (TUI)

- **Picker initial selection is snapshot at create-popup launch, not on
  each keystroke.** The create-popup reads `JIN_UI_AGENT` (transient
  default from `jin ui --agent`) and `config.default_agent` when it
  starts. Editing `config.yaml` while the TUI is already open does not
  change what the picker preselects on the next `n` press until the
  create-popup process re-launches (which it does per `n` press, so a
  new session created after saving config picks up the new default).

- **`jin ui --agent <kind>` writes an outer-tmux env, not a config
  value.** Starting `jin ui` without `--agent` on the same outer-tmux
  server clears the env (`UnsetEnvironment`) so a stale value from a
  previous `--agent codex` invocation does not silently preselect Codex.

- **The picker step disappears when only one adapter is registered.**
  `stepAgent` is skipped based on `len(agent.Kinds()) < 2`. Both create
  → agent and fleet-step Esc-back short-circuit past it so the flow
  matches the pre-picker UX in single-adapter builds.

## Session filter popup (TUI)

- **`/` opens a tmux popup, it does not filter inline.** Unlike `vi` / `less`
  / most other TUI apps where `/` starts an inline incremental search, jind-ai
  binds `/` at the outer tmux (`jin-mgr`) root key table to launch the
  session filter popup (`jin session-filter-popup`). Muscle memory from other
  tools ("press `/`, type, see the list narrow in place") will instead pop
  open a full-screen picker — this is intentional (see
  [architecture.md](architecture.md#session-filter-popup)), not a bug.

- **Requires tmux `display-popup` (tmux 3.2+).** The session filter shares
  its launch mechanism with the action palette and notification history
  popups — all three call `tmux display-popup -E`. On tmux 3.1 or older,
  `display-popup` doesn't exist, so the outer-tmux `bind-key` for `/` fires
  but the popup command errors out instead of opening. jind-ai's documented
  minimum is tmux 3.3+ (see README's Requirements section), which already
  covers this.

## Code Structure

- **Debug logging uses `internal/debug.NewLogger`**.
  Call `var debugLog = debug.NewLogger("filename.log")` to get a logger for any package.

- **config.Manager and config.StateManager are separate** instances. Do not confuse them.

- **Session.WorkDir is dynamically updated** (via hooks and tmux polling).
  Initial value = directory at creation time, but it follows when claude changes directory.

## Testing

- **Test coverage is ~40%**. Test files exist for all packages.
  Uses only the standard library (no testify, etc.). Add tests for new code.
  The `tmux.Runner` interface was introduced for testability.

## Concurrency

- **Session creation is protected by `createMu`** (at the daemon.Server level).
  This is a separate lock from `session.Manager.mu`.

- **I/O operations should be performed outside the lock** (to prevent deadlocks).
  Refer to the `List()` pattern: take a snapshot under RLock → release lock → read transcripts
