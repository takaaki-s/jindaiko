package session

// Package session owns the interface + supporting types that describe how
// jind-ai talks to an interactive agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, ...). The
// concrete implementations live under internal/agent/<kind>/; the session
// domain only knows this narrow surface so it can spawn / observe an agent
// without importing the adapter packages (import direction stays session ←
// agent, never the reverse).

// SpawnOptions is the input an Agent adapter receives when jind-ai needs to
// build the shell command that starts (or resumes) the agent inside a tmux
// pane.
type SpawnOptions struct {
	// JinSessionID is jind-ai's own session UUID. Adapters typically expose
	// it to the agent via the JIN_SESSION_ID env var so hook callbacks can
	// correlate back to a jind-ai session.
	JinSessionID string
	// AgentSessionID is the adapter-side persistent identifier (Claude
	// Code's --session-id / --resume UUID, for example). Empty on the very
	// first spawn of a fresh session.
	AgentSessionID string
	// AgentSessionStarted is true when the agent has been launched at
	// least once with AgentSessionID; adapters use it to decide between a
	// "new session" and a "resume" command line.
	AgentSessionStarted bool
	// WorkDir is the absolute directory the agent should start in (~ is
	// already expanded).
	WorkDir string
	// CustomEnv carries user-configured env vars from config.yaml. The
	// Manager forwards them to the shell command; adapters may also read
	// them if they need to.
	CustomEnv map[string]string
}

// SpawnPlan is what an Agent adapter returns to describe how to launch the
// agent. Manager splices the pieces into the fixed shell template it uses to
// wrap every session (`cd DIR; env -u ... KEY=VAL SHELL -ic 'COMMAND'`).
//
// Shell safety contract — how Manager treats each field:
//
//   - Command is placed inside single quotes; Manager defensively escapes
//     any single quote it finds. Adapters SHOULD NOT pre-escape their own
//     quotes: the replacement is designed for the raw form, and
//     double-escaping would break the wrapping. Emit the literal command
//     as if you were typing it into an interactive shell.
//   - ExtraEnv values are single-quoted by Manager (KEY='value'), so
//     arbitrary content survives — including whitespace and shell
//     metacharacters. Adapters can pass values verbatim.
//   - ExtraEnv keys and UnsetEnv entries must be POSIX env-var names
//     matching [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*. Manager rejects any that don't
//     (returns an error before the process is spawned).
//
// The contract is intentionally "Manager is the last line of defence":
// adapters return honest, unescaped values and Manager makes them safe.
type SpawnPlan struct {
	// Command is the single-line shell command that starts the agent
	// (e.g. `claude --settings /path/to/hooks.json --session-id UUID`).
	Command string
	// ExtraEnv is agent-specific KEY=VALUE pairs that must be exported for
	// the process. Manager adds them alongside the fixed JIN_SESSION_ID
	// group. Nil / empty is fine.
	ExtraEnv map[string]string
	// UnsetEnv lists env-var names that must be cleared before exec (env
	// -u NAME). Manager already unsets TMUX / TMUX_PANE unconditionally;
	// adapters add their own (Claude Code needs CLAUDECODE unset so
	// nested invocations work).
	UnsetEnv []string
}

// StatusSignal is the raw event an agent adapter interprets to decide the
// session's next Status. Manager builds it from whatever channel it caught
// the signal on (hook callback, pane output tail, ...) and hands it to
// StatusSource.Interpret.
type StatusSignal struct {
	// Kind identifies the transport: "hook" (live agent hook callback) or
	// "recover" (daemon-restart recovery asking the adapter to re-derive a
	// possibly stale status from its own persistent data). Adapters switch
	// on this and ignore signals they don't understand.
	//
	// Contract for "recover" verdicts: Manager applies only
	// StatusUpdate.Status — stale-state correction must not fire
	// notifications or touch the error field, so Notify / ErrorMessage /
	// ClearError are ignored.
	Kind string
	// Payload is an untyped key/value bag; the exact keys depend on Kind
	// and are adapter-defined. For "hook" the Manager fills in "event",
	// "notification_type", "stop_reason", "cwd"; for "recover" it fills in
	// "persisted_status", "agent_session_id", "workdir".
	Payload map[string]string
}

// StatusUpdate is the adapter's verdict on a signal: which Status the
// session should move to and whether a desktop notification should fire.
//
// ErrorMessage / ClearError work as a tri-state so adapters can distinguish
// three intents on the shared ErrorMessage field:
//
//   - ErrorMessage != ""            → set the field (adapter has a message)
//   - ClearError == true            → clear the field (agent recovered)
//   - both zero                     → leave whatever was there in place
//
// The Claude Code adapter uses the first form for StopFailure, the second
// for Stop / UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse / PostToolUse (the pre-refactor
// invariant "any post-error progression clears the message"), and the third
// for SessionEnd / Notification (which historically never touched the
// field). Adapters that don't care about error semantics can leave both
// zero — the field remains untouched.
