/**
 * jind-ai status reporter for opencode.
 *
 * This file is embedded in the `jin` binary and materialised at
 * <state>/opencode/plugin/jin.ts on every session start. Do not edit the
 * installed copy — edit internal/agent/opencode/plugin/jin.ts and rebuild.
 *
 * EVERY EXPORT IN THIS FILE MUST BE A FUNCTION. Because the module has no
 * default export, opencode falls back to getLegacyPlugins(), which walks
 * Object.values(mod) and throws `Plugin export is not a function` on the
 * first export that is neither a function nor an object exposing .server
 * (packages/opencode/src/plugin/index.ts). One `export const VERSION = "1"`
 * would take the whole plugin down, and opencode swallows a load failure as
 * a warning — so the symptom is status silently never updating. The name
 * `server` is conventional here, not required: only the default-export path
 * (used by npm-packaged plugins) checks names.
 *
 * opencode's bus vocabulary does not match the canonical event names
 * jind-ai's Manager keys its side effects on, so this plugin normalises
 * before calling `jin hook`:
 *
 *   session.created            -> SessionStart       (carries the real ses_ id)
 *   session.status {busy,...}  -> UserPromptSubmit   (thinking)
 *   session.status {idle}      -> (dropped)          see note 1
 *   session.idle               -> Stop               (idle)
 *   permission.asked           -> PermissionRequest  (permission)
 *   permission.replied         -> UserPromptSubmit   (back to thinking)
 *   session.error              -> StopFailure        (idle + error)
 *
 * Four behaviours of opencode drive the shape of this file:
 *
 *  1. Going idle publishes BOTH session.status{type:"idle"} and
 *     session.idle. Only session.idle is mapped, so a turn reports exactly
 *     one Stop.
 *  2. session.status{type:"busy"} fires once per step — ~9 times for a
 *     single trivial turn. Sending each one would multiply daemon IPC for
 *     no gain, so consecutive duplicates of the same canonical event are
 *     suppressed per session.
 *  3. The task tool creates CHILD sessions (tool/task.ts passes parentID)
 *     that publish session.created / session.status / session.idle on the
 *     same bus. Forwarding those is actively harmful: Manager re-keys
 *     Session.AgentSessionID on any hook whose session_id differs, so a
 *     child's SessionStart repoints the jin session at the subagent and
 *     breaks resume, and a child's idle reports the turn finished while
 *     the parent is still working. jind-ai therefore reports on an
 *     ALLOW-LIST of root sessions, never on "everything except known
 *     children" — see docs/gotchas.md for why the deny-list version is
 *     unsound.
 *  4. session.error's sessionID is optional in the schema, so errors are
 *     attributed to the last root session seen rather than discarded.
 *
 * The plugin is a pure observer. It deliberately uses the `event` hook
 * rather than the `permission.ask` hook: the latter can rewrite the
 * user's allow/deny decision, and a status reporter has no business on
 * that path.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT sent: `cwd`. The Claude and Codex adapters include it
 * so Manager can track worktree moves, but jind-ai already polls tmux's
 * pane_current_path for the same purpose, and opencode gives the plugin
 * only its start-up directory — which would go stale rather than track.
